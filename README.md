Club Mahindra presents DataOlympics in association with Analytics Vidhya. 
DataOlympics reflects the data-driven culture we have in Club Mahindra where we take up the most critical and impactful business challenges and try to solve them using data insights and advanced predictive models. In our journey to become a data-driven decision making organization, we invite you to DataOlympics, our flagship hackathon to identify the best talents in the industry to work on challenging business problems.

The team has so far developed and successfully deployed wide-range of machine learning and deep learning models like resort recommendations for members, prediction of booking cancellation to improve member experience, lead conversion propensity and many more are in the pipeline. DataOlympics is our endeavour to invite the passionate Data Scientists and Engineers to get a feel of what it looks like solving an RoI driven business problem.
